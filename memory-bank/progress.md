## What Works

### Core Contract Functionality

- ✅ Contract initialization (opcode 0)
- ✅ OOGA token claiming (opcode 1)
- ✅ OOGA to BOOGA exchange (opcode 2)
- ✅ OOGA balance queries (opcode 3)
- ✅ BOOGA balance queries (opcode 4)
- ✅ Total OOGA supply queries (opcode 5)
- ✅ Total BOOGA supply queries (opcode 6)

### Storage Management

- ✅ User balance tracking for both token types
- ✅ Total supply tracking for both token types
- ✅ Efficient storage key format

### Error Handling

- ✅ Balance overflow protection
- ✅ Insufficient balance checks
- ✅ Invalid opcode handling

### Build System

- ✅ WebAssembly compilation
- ✅ Size optimizations
- ✅ gzip compression

## Known Issues

1. **Testing Environment**
   - Testing the contract without the actual Alkanes runtime is challenging
   - Current mock implementations have memory management issues
   - Need to develop a more robust testing strategy

2. **Feature Flag Configuration**
   - Need to ensure feature flags are properly configured for all build targets
   - WebAssembly-specific code needs to be properly isolated
   - Test code needs to be compatible with both WebAssembly and native targets

3. **Memory Management in Tests**
   - Using static mutable storage in tests causes memory safety issues
   - Need to find a better approach for simulating storage in tests
   - Consider using thread-local storage or a different testing architecture

4. **API Compatibility**
   - Need to ensure our contract is compatible with the latest Alkanes API
   - Documentation needs to be kept in sync with implementation
   - Consider version pinning for dependencies

## Recent Progress
