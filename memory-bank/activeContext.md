# OOGA BOOGA Active Context

## Current Status

The OOGA BOOGA contract is currently in a functional state with all core features implemented:

- Contract structure is complete
- Token claiming functionality is implemented
- Token exchange mechanism is working
- Balance queries are functional
- Total supply tracking is in place

## Recent Changes

The initial implementation of the contract has been completed with:

- Core contract structure following Alkanes patterns
- Storage management for token balances
- Opcode handlers for all required operations
- Error handling for edge cases
- Build configuration for WebAssembly target
- Feature flags for conditional compilation
- Documentation of the Alkanes Runtime API

## Current Focus

The current development focus is on:

1. **Testing and Validation**
   - Ensuring all opcodes work as expected
   - Verifying storage operations
   - Testing error handling paths

2. **Optimization**
   - Reducing binary size
   - Improving execution efficiency
   - Minimizing storage operations

3. **Documentation**
   - Completing code documentation
   - Creating usage examples
   - Documenting deployment process

## Active Decisions

### 1. Storage Key Format

We've decided to use a path-like format for storage keys:
- `/ooga-balance/{address}` for OOGA balances
- `/booga-balance/{address}` for BOOGA balances
- `/total-ooga` for total OOGA supply
- `/total-booga` for total BOOGA supply

This format provides:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy identification of key purpose
- Consistent pattern for key generation

### 2. Error Handling Approach

We're using the `anyhow` crate for error handling because:
- It simplifies error creation and propagation
- It provides good error context
- It reduces boilerplate code

### 3. Build Optimization Strategy

We're focusing on size optimization rather than speed because:
- Smaller contract size reduces deployment costs
- The contract operations are simple and not compute-intensive
- WebAssembly size directly impacts deployment and execution costs

## Next Steps

### Short-term Tasks

1. **Implement Unit Tests**
   - Create tests for each opcode handler
   - Test edge cases and error conditions
   - Verify token balance tracking

2. **Add Code Documentation**
   - Document public functions
   - Explain storage key format
   - Clarify opcode parameters

3. **Optimize Build Process**
   - Explore additional WASM optimization tools
   - Measure and reduce binary size further
   - Benchmark execution efficiency

### Medium-term Goals

1. **Create Integration Tests**
   - Test complete contract flows
   - Verify interaction patterns
   - Validate multi-user scenarios

2. **Prepare for Deployment**
   - Document deployment process
   - Create deployment scripts
   - Prepare verification tools

3. **Enhance Documentation**
   - Create user guide
   - Document API interface
   - Provide usage examples

## Open Questions

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Are there additional optimizations we can apply to reduce binary size?
   - Can we improve storage access patterns?

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - What's the best approach for testing Alkanes contracts?
   - How can we simulate the Alkanes environment for testing?

3. **Deployment Process**
   - What's the exact process for deploying to the Alkanes platform?
   - How can we verify successful deployment?

## Current Challenges

1. **WebAssembly Optimization**
   - Finding the optimal balance between size and functionality
   - Ensuring compatibility with the Alkanes runtime

2. **Testing Environment**
   - Setting up a proper testing environment for Alkanes contracts
   - Simulating the Alkanes runtime for local testing
   - Handling memory management in tests without the actual runtime
   - Creating effective mocks for the Alkanes API

3. **Feature Flag Management**
   - Properly configuring feature flags for different build targets
   - Ensuring tests run correctly with or without Alkanes dependencies
   - Managing conditional compilation for WebAssembly vs native targets

4. **Documentation Completeness**
   - Ensuring all aspects of the contract are well-documented
   - Making the documentation accessible to different audiences
   - Keeping API documentation in sync with implementation
